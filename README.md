## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code.git

(This is to set up a local python environment, similar towards package.json)

   ```bash
   # In your current terminal, run:
   python3 -m venv aoc_env

   # Activate your environment
   source aoc_env/bin/activate

   # Sync packages to your environment
   pip install -r requirements.txt # if you are using pip
      # OR 
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt # if you are using pip3
   ```
